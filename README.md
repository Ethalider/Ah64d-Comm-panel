Heres is the Ah64d Comm panel 3d print files for case and a chair mount I just glued to the casing and attached to my secret labs chair via arm rest holes.

You will need:
11x Potentiometers
6x 3 way toggle switches
1x 8 way rotary knob
1x push button
And either Leo bodnar or a arduino board would work.
